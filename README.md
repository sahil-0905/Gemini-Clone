Built a functional clone of Gemini, using React JS as the frontend framework and CSS for styling. This project showcased my ability to integrate third-party APIs seamlessly, enabling real-time data fetching and manipulation.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

- React JS for building responsive and dynamic UI components
- CSS for styling and layout management
- API integration for fetching and handling real-time data
- Problem-solving and debugging in a fast-paced development environment

Major Learning Outcome:

Gained hands-on experience with API integration, understanding how to handle API requests, errors, and data parsing.
